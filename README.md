Battleship project following The Odin Project's javascript course.

Play battleship against a computer opponent. Place your ships on the board, changing the orientation to your desired positions.

In this project I learned how to change arrays and objects through on-screen events, changing the array and object states and return those changes visually to the user.

An austere vanilla css layout that I aim to improve once I have learned more design knowledge. Some additional changes I plan to implement in the near future, include:

Add focus for when the piece is being selected in the piece display

Add smarter computer ai

Do not trigger computer attack if the player clicks an already targeted spot

Scaling of components with page size
